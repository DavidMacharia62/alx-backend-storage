## Introduction

### What is NoSQL?

NoSQL, or "Not Only SQL," is a type of database management system that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in a way other than the traditional tabular relations used in relational databases (SQL databases). NoSQL databases are designed to be more flexible, scalable, and better suited for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.

---

## SQL vs. NoSQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL databases differ in their data storage models and query languages.

### Differences:

- **Data Model:**
  - **SQL:** Relational databases use a structured model with predefined schemas.
  - **NoSQL:** NoSQL databases employ various data models, such as document-oriented, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, or graph databases.

- **Schema:**
  - **SQL:** Requires a predefined schema, and any changes can be complex.
  - **NoSQL:** Schema-less or dynamic schema, allowing for easier adaptation to changing data requirements.

- **Scaling:**
  - **SQL:** Typically scaled vertically (adding more resources to a single server).
  - **NoSQL:** Horizontally scalable, allowing for the distribution of data across multiple servers.

- **Transaction Support:**
  - **SQL:** ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliant, ensuring data integrity.
  - **NoSQL:** May sacrifice ACID properties for improved scalability and performance.

---

## ACID

ACID is a set of properties that ensure database transactions are processed reliably.

- **Atomicity:** Transactions are treated as a single, indivisible unit, either fully completed or fully rolled back.
  
- **Consistency:** A transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, preserving integrity.

- **Isolation:** Transactions are isolated from each other until they are completed, preventing interference.

- **Durability:** Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent and survive future system failures.

## Document Storage

NoSQL databases often use a document-oriented approach for data storage.

- **Document Database:**
  - **Definition:** Stores and retrieves data as documents (e.g., JSON, BSON).
  - **Characteristics:** Documents can contain nested structures, making them suitable for representing complex data.

---

## Types of NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases can be categorized into various types based on their data models:

1. **Document Stores:**
   - Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB.
   - Store data in flexible, JSON-like documents.

2. **Key-Value Stores:**
   - Examples: Redis, DynamoDB.
   - Simple key-value pairs for data storage.

3. **Column-Family Stores:**
   - Examples: Cassandra, HBase.
   - Organize data into columns instead of rows.

4. **Graph Databases:**
   - Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune.
   - Focus on relationships between entities.

---

## Benefits of NoSQL Databases

1. **Scalability:**
   - NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scaling, distributing data across multiple servers.

2. **Flexibility:**
   - Adaptable to changing data structures without the need for a predefined schema.

3. **Performance:**
   - Well-suited for read and write-intensive workloads, often outperforming traditional relational databases.

4. **Handling Big Data:**
   - Efficiently manages large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.

5. **Cost-Effective:**
   - Horizontal scaling can be more cost-effective than vertical scaling.

## Querying in NoSQL

Querying in NoSQL databases depends on the type of database being used.

- **Document Stores (e.g., MongoDB):**
  - Query using a flexible syntax based on the structure of the document.
  - Example: `db.collection.find({ key: value })`.

- **Key-Value Stores (e.g., Redis):**
  - Directly access data using keys.
  - Example: `GET key`.

- **Graph Databases (e.g., Neo4j):**
  - Use query languages like Cypher to traverse relationships.
  - Example: `MATCH (n)-[r]->(m) RETURN n, r, m`.

---

## Inserting/Updating/Deleting Data

Manipulating data in NoSQL databases is performed differently based on the type of database.

- **Document Stores (e.g., MongoDB):**
  - Insert: `db.collection.insertOne({ key: value })`.
  - Update: `db.collection.updateOne({ filter }, { $set: { key: value } })`.
  - Delete: `db.collection.deleteOne({ filter })`.

- **Key-Value Stores (e.g., Redis):**
  - Insert/Update: `SET key value`.
  - Delete: `DEL key`.

- **Graph Databases (e.g., Neo4j):**
  - Insert: `CREATE (node:Label { key: value })`.
  - Update: `MATCH (n:Label { key: old_value }) SET n.key = new_value`.
  - Delete: `MATCH (n:Label { key: value }) DELETE n`.

## Using MongoDB

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a popular NoSQL database. Here's a brief guide on using MongoDB:

1. **Installation:**
   - Download and install MongoDB from the official website.

2. **Start MongoDB:**
   - Run the MongoDB server.

3. **Connect to MongoDB:**
   - Use the MongoDB shell or a programming language-specific driver to connect.

4. **Create a Database:**
   - `use mydatabase`.

5. **Create a Collection:**
   - `db.createCollection("mycollection")`.

6. **Insert Data:**
   - `db.mycollection.insertOne({ key: value })`.

7. **Query Data:**
   - `db.mycollection.find({ key: value })`.

8. **Update Data:**
   - `db.mycollection.updateOne({ filter }, { $set: { key: new_value } })`.

9. **Delete Data:**
   - `db.mycollection.deleteOne({ filter })`.

10. **Additional Operations:**
    - Explore advanced features like indexing, aggregation, and replication.
